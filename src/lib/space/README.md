# Space

This domain converts space measures in some arbitrary unit to concrete pixels measures. The arbitrary values have names with `data`, e.g. `dataSize` and `dataPosition`, while the pixel measured ones use `screen`, e.g. `screenSize` and `screenPosition`. This can be revised in the future. Naming stuff is hard.
